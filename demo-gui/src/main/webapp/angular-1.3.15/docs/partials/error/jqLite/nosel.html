    <pre class="minerr-errmsg" error-display="Looking up elements via selectors is not supported by jqLite! See: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element">Looking up elements via selectors is not supported by jqLite! See: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element</pre>
</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>In order to keep Angular small, Angular implements only a subset of the selectors in <a href="api/ng/function/angular.element#angular-s-jqlite">jqLite</a>.
This error occurs when a jqLite instance is invoked with a selector other than this subset.</p>
<p>In order to resolve this error, rewrite your code to only use tag name selectors and manually traverse the DOM using the APIs provided by jqLite.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can include a full version of jQuery, which Angular will automatically use and that will make all selectors available.</p>
