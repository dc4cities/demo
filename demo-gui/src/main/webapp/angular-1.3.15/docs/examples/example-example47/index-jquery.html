        I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

        <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying
           on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in
           strict mode). As such, the content of this section is not
           interpolated, and there should be an error in your web console.
