<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when the <a href="api/ng/service/$location#state">$location.state</a> method is used when <a href="api/ng/provider/$locationProvider#html5Mode">$locationProvider.html5Mode</a> is not turned on or the browser used doesn&#39;t support the HTML5 History API (for example, IE9 or Android 2.3).</p>
<p>To avoid this error, either drop support for those older browsers or avoid using this method.</p>

</div>
