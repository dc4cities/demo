<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when attempting to copy an object to itself. Calling <a href="api/ng/function/angular.copy">angular.copy</a> with a <code>destination</code> object deletes
all of the elements or properties on <code>destination</code> before copying to it. Copying
an object to itself is not supported. Make sure to check your calls to
<code>angular.copy</code> and avoid copying objects or arrays to themselves.</p>
