<p><code>ngView</code> is a directive that complements the <a href="api/ngRoute/service/$route">$route</a> service by
including the rendered template of the current route into the main layout (<code>index.html</code>) file.
Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the
configuration of the <code>$route</code> service.</p>
