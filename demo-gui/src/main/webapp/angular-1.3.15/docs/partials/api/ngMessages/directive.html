        <td><p><code>ngMessages</code> is a directive that is designed to show and hide messages based on the state
of a key/value object that it listens on. The directive itself compliments error message
reporting with the <code>ngModel</code> $error object (which stores a key/value state of validation errors).</p>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="api/ngMessages/directive/ngMessage">ngMessage</a></td>
        <td><p><code>ngMessage</code> is a directive with the purpose to show and hide a particular message.
For <code>ngMessage</code> to operate, a parent <code>ngMessages</code> directive on a parent DOM element
must be situated since it determines which messages are visible based on the state
of the provided key/value map that <code>ngMessages</code> listens on.</p>
