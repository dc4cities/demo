</h1>

<div>
    <pre class="minerr-errmsg" error-display="Illegal use of ngTransclude directive in the template! No parent directive that requires a transclusion found. Element: {0}">Illegal use of ngTransclude directive in the template! No parent directive that requires a transclusion found. Element: {0}</pre>
</div>

<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>Occurs when an <code>ngTransclude</code> occurs without a transcluded ancestor element.</p>
<p>This error often occurs when you have forgotten to set <code>transclude: true</code> in some directive definition, and then used <code>ngTransclude</code> in the directive&#39;s template.</p>
<p>To resolve, either remove the offending <code>ngTransclude</code> or check that <code>transclude: true</code> is included in the intended directive definition.</p>
<p>Consult the API documentation for <a href="guide/directive">writing directives</a> to learn more.</p>
