<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when <a href="api/ng/service/$compile"><code>$compile</code></a> attempts to fetch a template from some URL, and the request fails.</p>
<p>To resolve this error, ensure that the URL of the template is spelled correctly and resolves to correct absolute URL.
The <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/network#network_panel_overview">Chrome Developer Tools</a> might also be helpful in determining why the request failed.</p>
<p>If you are using <a href="api/ng/service/$templateCache"><code>$templateCache</code></a> to pre-load templates, ensure that the cache was populated with the template.</p>
