        <td><a href="api/ngTouch/directive/ngClick">ngClick</a></td>
        <td><p>A more powerful replacement for the default ngClick designed to be used on touchscreen
devices. Most mobile browsers wait about 300ms after a tap-and-release before sending
the click event. This version handles them immediately, and then prevents the
following click event from propagating.</p>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="api/ngTouch/directive/ngSwipeLeft">ngSwipeLeft</a></td>
        <td><p>Specify custom behavior when an element is swiped to the left on a touchscreen device.
A leftward swipe is a quick, right-to-left slide of the finger.
Though ngSwipeLeft is designed for touch-based devices, it will work with a mouse click and drag
too.</p>
