<h2>Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>Occurs when you try to use the name <code>hasOwnProperty</code> in a context where it is not allowed.
Generally, a name cannot be <code>hasOwnProperty</code> because it is used, internally, on a object
and allowing such a name would break lookups on this object.</p>
